# 3DEngine

Using Java to write a 3D Engine for exercising and reinforce my computer grahic knowledge.

**Demo:**

![camera](./screenshot/camera.png)

**Texture Demo(with some troubles):**
![texture](./screenshot/texture.png)

**About perspective zNear and zFar**

The zNear & zFar values define the distance between the camera position & the near and far clipping planes, respectively. 

![perspective](./screenshot/perspective.png)

There is a good picture to discribe the perspective.
