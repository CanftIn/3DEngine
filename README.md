# 3DEngine

Using Java to write a 3D Engine for exercising and reinforce my computer grahic knowledge.

**Demo:**

<img src="./screenshot/camera.png" width = "400" height = "300" alt="camera" align=center />

**Texture Demo(with some troubles):**

![texture](./screenshot/texture.png)

**About perspective zNear and zFar**

The zNear & zFar values define the distance between the camera position & the near and far clipping planes, respectively. 

![perspective](./screenshot/perspective.png)

There is a good picture to discribe the perspective.

<img src="./screenshot/perspectiveNote1.png" width = "400" height = "300" alt="perspectiveNote1" align=center />

## TODO LIST
- fix key press bug
- add lighting
